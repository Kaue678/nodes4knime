    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node lets you handle CDK molecules which are fragmented into different parts. This is useful because
            some algorithms won't work with unconnected structures. You have either the choice to completely remove the
            rows that contain fragmented molecules, or to remove all fragments except the biggest one.
            <br />
            <i>
                This node can process the input table in parallel. However, by default the usage of threads is disabled
                in the CDK plugin, because the CDK code may not be thread-safe in all places. If you want to enable
                multi-threading, change the setting in the KNIME preferences.
