    <shortDescription>
        Calculates the RMSD between different conformers
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Creates a new columns containing the RMSD distances between different conformers (required 3D coordinates). 
        The computations are based of the <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a> toolkit. At the moment two types of
         RMSD calculations are possible. One based on the alignment using the Kabsch algorithm and the other based on the 
         isomorphic alignment of the molecular structure and using the global geometry.        
        </intro>

        <option name="Column with molecules">Select the column containing the molecular structure with 3D coordinates</option>
        <option name="Alignment algorithm">Select the type of alignment to be used for the RMSD calculation</option>
