    <shortDescription>
        Node to evaluate the 3D similarity between two specified molecules as well as generate the 12 descriptors used to characterize the 3D structure.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node implements a fast descriptor based 3D similarity measure described by Ballester et al ([Bellester, P.J. and Richards, W.G. , Ultrafast shape recognition to search compound databases for similar molecular shapes, Journal of Computational Chemistry, 2007, 28:1711-1723]). 
        The approach calculates the distances of each atom to four specific points: the centroid of the molecule, the atom that is closest to the centroid, the atom that is farthest from the centroid and the atom that is farthest from the previous atom. Thus we get 4 sets of distance distributions. The final descriptor set is generated by evaluating the first three moments of each distance distribution.</intro>
