    <name>SMARTS Query</name>
    <shortDescription>Filters molecules based on a SMARTS search</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Matches a list of molecules against a list of SMARTS patterns. Molecules that match at least one SMARTS 
            pattern are included in the first output table. Molecules that match no SMARTS pattern are directed to the 
            second output table. Stereochemistry is supported by default. If "Match Unique" is selected, a column with
            the unique count of matches is appended. If multiple SMARTS query strings are provided, the sum total is
            calculated.
