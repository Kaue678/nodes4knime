	<shortDescription>
		Holistic descriptors described by Todeschini et al. The descriptors are based on a number of atom
		weightings. There are 5 different possible weightings implemented.
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Creates new columns holding the calculated WHIM molecular properties computed for each <i>fully configured</i> 
			3D structure. The computations are based on the <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a> toolkit. For unconnected 
			molecules, only the largest fragment is used by the descriptor.

		<option name="Molecule column">Select the column containing the molecular structure.</option>
		<option name="Weightings">Possible weighting schemes used for the properties calculations.</option>
