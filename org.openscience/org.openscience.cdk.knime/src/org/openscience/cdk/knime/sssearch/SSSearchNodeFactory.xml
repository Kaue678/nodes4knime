        <intro>
            <p>This node allows you to draw a fragment in the dialog. Upon execution
            the molecules from the input table are divided into two sets, one with
            all molecules that contain the fragments, the other with all molecules
            that do not contain it.
            </p>

                This node can process the input table in parallel. However, by default the usage of threads is disabled
                in the CDK plugin, because the CDK code may not be thread-safe in all places. If you want to enable
                multi-threading, change the setting in the KNIME preferences.
