    <shortDescription>Calculates molecular properties using CDK</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Create new columns holding molecular properties, computed for each
            structure. The computations are based on the
            <a href="http://cdk.sf.net">CDK</a> toolkit and include logP, molecular weight,
            number of aromatic bonds, and many others.

                This node can process the input table in parallel. However, by default the usage of threads is disabled
                in the CDK plugin, because the CDK code may not be thread-safe in all places. If you want to enable
                multi-threading, change the setting in the KNIME preferences.
