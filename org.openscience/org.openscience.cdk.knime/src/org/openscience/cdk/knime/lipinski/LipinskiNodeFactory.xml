    <name>Lipinski's Rule-of-Five</name>
    <shortDescription>Calculates the number failures of the Lipinski's Rule Of Five.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	The Rule of 5 got its name from the cutoff values for each of the four parameters 
        	that define the potential of a drug candidate for good absorption: all of these 
        	values are close to five or a multiple of five. The original definition, given by 
        	Christopher A. Lipinski, says that poor absorption (or permeation) is more 
        	likely when: the molecule has more than 5 H-bond donors and more than 
        	10 H-bond acceptors, its molecular weight is over 500, and its LogP is over 5.

                This node can process the input table in parallel. However, by default the usage of threads is disabled
                in the CDK plugin, because the CDK code may not be thread-safe in all places. If you want to enable
                multi-threading, change the setting in the KNIME preferences.
