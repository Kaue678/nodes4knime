    <shortDescription>Calculates the number failures of the Lipinski's Rule Of Five.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        	The Rule of 5 got its name from the cutoff values for each of the four parameters 
        	that define the potential of a drug candidate for good absorption: all of these 
        	values are close to five or a multiple of five. The original definition, given by 
        	Christopher A. Lipinski, says that poor absorption (or permeation) is more 
        	likely when: the molecule has more than 5 H-bond donors and more than 
        	10 H-bond acceptors, its molecular weight is over 500, and its LogP is over 5.

        	<br/>
        	In addition to the four rules defined by Lipinski, the extended rule of five takes 
        	rotatable bond counts into account. This implementation considers a rotatable bond count
        	greater than ten as rule violation.
